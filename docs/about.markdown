I was born in 1998 in Karaganda, Kazakhstan. I graduated from Nazarbayev University with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics in 2020. I am currently working towards my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, specializing in Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations with an emphasis on Scientific Computing. I am expecting to graduate in 2025.

Outside school, I enjoy photography ([Behance](https://www.behance.net/chromomons)), writing reviews on albums and film ([RYM](https://www.rateyourmusic.com/~chromomons)), and play CS:GO.
