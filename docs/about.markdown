I was born in 1998 in [Karaganda, Kazakhstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaganda). I graduated from [Nazarbayev University](https://nu.edu.kz/) with a BS in Computer Science in 2020. I am currently working towards my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, specializing in Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations with an emphasis on Scientific Computing at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/). I am expecting to graduate in 2025.

Outside school, I enjoy photography ([BÄ“hance](https://www.behance.net/chromomons)), writing reviews on albums and film ([RYM](https://www.rateyourmusic.com/~chromomons)), and playing first-person shooters.

I am fluent in Russian, and speak some Kazakh.
